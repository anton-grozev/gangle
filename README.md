## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Input Parameters
- **l [mm]**: Distance from cone apex to the end of the axis offset segment that lies on the cone axis
- **d [mm]**: Distance between the two axes, i.e., the length of the axis offset segment
- **θ [°]**: Angle between drill and cone axes
- **β [°]**: Angle between cone axis and generatrix (2β is the apex angle)
- **Point Coordinates**: X, Y, Z coordinates relative to drill tip
